Welcome to the Adventures of Ace! Ace is a Bulldog American 
Staffordshire Terrier mix who loves to play ball. An issue has arose, though, 
where he has lost his ball and is sad because of this. He is looking for someone to assist him 
in searching and wants to know if that will be you? Work through this story game to 
find out what happened to Ace's ball and be his hero. Watch out for sad Ace, though, 
because one wrong move can cause great disappointment!
