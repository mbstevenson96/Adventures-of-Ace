  'Great! The first place Ace would like to investigate is his favorite chair. He spends long hours playing with his toys in thie chair so there are high hopes his ball will be here. It looks like there is sad news to give as his ball is not here. What are the next steps?'
  'Wonderful! Ace is excited to have a helper find his ball. Watch his excited show while he waits to be let outside.'

  'YAY!!! You helped Ace find his ball and he is so happy!'
